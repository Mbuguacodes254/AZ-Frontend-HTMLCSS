          Meet Elizabeth Wairimu Mbugua, a passionate individual whose interests
          span a diverse range of activities. From her love for swimming, she
          finds solace and tranquility in the water, and through volunteering,
          she wholeheartedly dedicates her time to making a positive impact in
          her community. When she's not exploring new destinations and immersing
          herself in different cultures during her travels, she can often be
          found curled up with a good book, losing herself in captivating
          stories. As a part-time article writer, Elizabeth is driven by her
          desire to expand her horizons and transition into the world of
          technology. Currently, she is pursuing her front-end development
          studies at Azubi Africa, where her enthusiasm lies in contributing to
          Africa's technological awakening. Elizabeth firmly believes that
          Africa holds boundless untapped potential, and she is determined to
          play her part in propelling the continent to reach the technological
          heights of the Western world. With a strong sense of responsibility
          towards her motherland, she is resolute in pulling her weight to bring
          about positive change and make this vision a reality.
