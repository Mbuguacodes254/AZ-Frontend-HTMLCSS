    <p>
      I love pets. Infact, I have three felines at home, all boys. The first is
      aged 7. He is a big boy and who I was gifted to me by my brother while I
      was still in University. The other two are turning six months on August
      21. These two are part of a litter of three that were born at home. I have
      a calico male; that's actually quite rare and two orange boys. I love my
      cats very much.
